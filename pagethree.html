            <p>AI is relevant to any intellectual task. Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here. Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the AI effect.

                High-profile examples of AI include autonomous vehicles (such as drones and self-driving cars), medical diagnosis, creating art (such as poetry), proving mathematical theorems, playing games (such as Chess or Go), search engines (such as Google Search), online assistants (such as Siri), image recognition in photographs, spam filtering, predicting flight delays,prediction of judicial decisions,targeting online advertisements, and energy storage
                
                With social media sites overtaking TV as a source for news for young people and news organizations increasingly reliant on social media platforms for generating distribution,major publishers now use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to post stories more effectively and generate higher volumes of traffic.
                
                AI can also produce Deepfakes, a content-altering technology.</p>
                <p> ZDNet reports, "It presents something that did not actually occur," Though 88% of Americans believe Deepfakes can cause more harm than good, only 47% of them believe they can be targeted. The boom of election year also opens public discourse to threats of videos of falsified politician media.</p>
